    <h1>SURFING</h1>
    <p>All my life I've loved to
        <strong>surf</strong>. My favorite surfer of all time is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Slater" title="Kelly wikipedia">Kelly Slater</a> 
        . He's been a huge inspiration to me, and you can see all his statistics <a href="https://www.worldsurfleague.com/athletes/553/kelly-slater">here</a> .
